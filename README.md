# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applied in React Component

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS with React: Tailwind classes not being applied correctly to elements, despite seemingly correct implementation.

## Bug Description
The provided code snippet demonstrates a React component that attempts to use Tailwind CSS classes for styling a button and a paragraph element. However, the styling is not applied, leading to unexpected rendering.

## Bug Solution
The solution involves ensuring the Tailwind directives are properly configured within the project's setup and the React component's structure.

Specifically, this includes:

1. Verifying the Tailwind configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) is correctly set up to include the necessary paths for scanning your components.
2.  Making sure that the `@tailwind` directives are present in the CSS file which is generated by the `tailwindcss` CLI.
3. Implementing the Tailwind classes correctly in the React component's JSX, ensuring that there are no typos or naming discrepancies. 
4. Correct import of CSS.

By carefully addressing these steps, we can ensure Tailwind CSS classes are applied consistently and correctly within the React component, resolving the styling issues.
